# Contributing

Thank you for being willing to contribute!

**Working on your first Pull Request?** You can learn more from [Your First Pull Request on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)

## Project setup

1. Navigate to the [testcafe-cli-select GitHub repository](https://github.com/razvanvancea/testcafe-cli-select.git)
2. Click the Fork button to create your copy of the repository
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
4. Create a branch for your PR with `git checkout -b pr/your-branch-name`

> Tip: Keep your `main` branch pointing at the original repository and make
> pull requests from branches on your fork. To do this, run:
>
> ```
> git remote add upstream https://github.com/razvanvancea/testcafe-cli-select
> git fetch upstream
> git branch --set-upstream-to=upstream/main main
> ```
>
> This will add the original repository as a "remote" called "upstream" Then
> fetch the git information from that remote, then set your local `main`
> branch to use the upstream main branch whenever you run `git pull`. Then you
> can make all of your pull request branches based on this `main` branch.
> Whenever you want to update your version of `main`, simply run `git pull`.
